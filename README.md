The full dataset of 26 features was created by Shima Mohammadi. The full dataset in not included, however the reduced one is which was only modified slightly. The bitrate for the reference images wasn't calculated, therefore arbitrary values were set.

# General
`main.m` runs the tests/models.
`main_visualizations.m` runs the visualizations.
Exception: running `experiment_6_H` in the main will produce a plot right away.
